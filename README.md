# k8s4all
## Objective: To learn about the value of containers and trace the journey from code development to deprecation through rationalization.
This is an up-an-adam (Batteries Included) tutorial of how to go from Docker to full fledged k8s and even DC/OS). This is a soup to nuts, bare bones tutorial.
- Note, This touches on the Architecture breifly, but there are a myriad of different ways to tackle this. 
- This guide when complete will take you from Hand provisioning a virtual machine to deploying a discoverable API Server.
- This repo tries not to reinvent the wheel, but it does pull from some staple technoligies.
